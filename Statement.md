## Problem Statement

It has, till date, been expected of the management to assume and manage a library's collection and member records, which is a laborious process in the case of small libraries using entirely manual processes. Over time, the tracking of which books are currently out, which ones are borrowed, and who is responsible for them becomes extremely time-consuming. The staff may misplace issued books or fail to keep track of reliable records, which creates much confusion and, at times, frustration among the librarians and members. With so much information to manage-and the risk of misplaced or damaged registers-the slightest mistake could lead to unnecessary disputes or loss of valuable books.

With these challenges taken into consideration, this project aims to design and implement a simple, efficient approach to the Library Management System in Java. Primary among these is the need to provide an orderly and reliable manner by which daily library operations such as adding new books, registering members, and noting which member has which book at any given time, are performed. Using a digital system could minimize human error while also enabling library staff to access and update data much more rapidly than they would have with handwriting. This transition can greatly simplify and streamline the workflow of educational or community libraries, ensuring that books and details of members are kept up-to-date.

The project aims to show how even a simple console-based software solution can make all the difference in how libraries function. The system will be designed using only core Java programming concepts in order to help simplify daily tasks and ensure information isn't overlooked. The objective is to enable librarians and enhance the library experience for everyone with technology that is dependable, approachable, and easy to interact with.

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes the development of a console-based application that manages the core operations of a library. The system focuses on:

  * Managing book records including addition, deletion, updating, and searching
  * Registering and maintaining member information
  * Handling book issue and return processes
  * Tracking availability of books
  * Displaying reports for issued and available books

The project is limited to small and medium-sized academic libraries.

## Target Users
The primary users of this system are:
  * Librarians / Library Staff – Responsible for managing books and members
  * Educational Institutions – Schools and colleges needing basic library automation
  * Students – Indirect users who benefit from accurate book availability and tracking

The system is designed to be simple and user-friendly which allows the non technical users to operate easily.

## High-level features 
* Book management (add, update, delete, search books)
* Member registration and record maintenance
* Book issue and return system
* Availability tracking of books
* Transaction history display
* Simple menu-driven interface
* Input validation and error handling
* Modular and scalable program structure
